### Hi there 👋

<!--
**larizzatg/larizzatg** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

I'm a person 😁
That works as web developer 💻
I develop webs 🌱, watch them grow, tug them a little, water them a lot 🌳. 

I kill personal projects ♻️, sometimes I create them before I kill them 🚀.

I enjoy programming and I love the posibilities it gives you to solve problems. 
I'm interested in Social Entrepreneurship. 

What's next? 🚋
