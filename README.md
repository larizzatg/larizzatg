#### What about me?

I'm another one of you, a person, (if you are an alien let's chat). I collect kawaii objects, eat sour candies, encourage curiosity, and search meta topics. I believe we can make a better world with software and thrive to have a social impact with the products I make or help making.

#### What about now?
- I work as a web developer, at the front end of the island, with Vue and SCSS.


#### What's next?
- Create a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) and [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/).
